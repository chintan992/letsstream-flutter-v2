- **lib/src/core/services/simple_cached_repository.dart:** Added `getTvShows` method for consistent API access

**Performance Improvements:**
- Reduced widget rebuilds by separating concerns into smaller widgets
- AppBar now uses const constructor, preventing rebuilds when content changes
- Error and content widgets are now independent, only rebuilding when their specific data changes

- Improved memory management with auto-dispose providers
- Better error handling and loading states

**Runtime Error Fixes:**
- Fixed LateInitializationError in CacheService by adding proper service initialization in main.dart
- Added Hive adapter registration and service initialization sequence
- Added initialization checks to prevent accessing uninitialized boxes
- Services now properly initialize before app startup
- Fixed SeasonsAndEpisodesSection debug breakpoint by adding defensive null checks in initState()
- Removed unnecessary null comparisons and assertions to resolve analyzer warnings

**Next Steps:**
- Add accessibility features: semantic labels, dynamic text sizing, screen reader support
