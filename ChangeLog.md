# Let's Stream - UI Improvements ChangeLog

This document tracks all changes made during the UI improvement implementation based on the UI_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md analysis.

## Implementation Plan Overview

The improvement plan consists of 21 prioritized tasks across four main categories:
- Performance & Responsiveness
- User Experience
- Feature Enhancements
- Code Quality & Security

## Change History

### Milestone 1: Setup and Initial Performance Profiling
**Date:** 2025-01-XX
**Tasks Completed:**
- Created ChangeLog.md for tracking changes
- Conducted initial performance profiling to identify widget rebuilds
- Optimized widgets with const constructors and Riverpod select

**Changes Made:**
- **lib/src/features/home/presentation/home_screen.dart:**
  - Split HomeScreen into smaller, focused widgets: `_HomeAppBar`, `_HomeContent`, `_HomeErrorWidget`
  - Made AppBar a const widget to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
  - Extracted static helper methods for carousel configuration and error handling
  - Improved widget tree structure to reduce rebuild scope

**Performance Improvements:**
- Reduced widget rebuilds by separating concerns into smaller widgets
- AppBar now uses const constructor, preventing rebuilds when content changes
- Error and content widgets are now independent, only rebuilding when their specific data changes
- Better separation of business logic from UI rendering

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with lazy loading implementation
- Add image optimization features
