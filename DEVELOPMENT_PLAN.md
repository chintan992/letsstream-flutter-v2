# Let's Stream: Comprehensive Development Plan

This document outlines a strategic plan for developing "Let's Stream," a modern media discovery app using Flutter. The plan covers a phased roadmap, a scalable project structure, and key UI/UX considerations to create an engaging user experience.

## 1. Phased Development Roadmap 🗺️

We'll break down the development into three manageable phases to ensure a steady workflow and iterative progress.

### Phase 1: Foundation, UI/UX & Core API Integration (Weeks 1-3)

This initial phase focuses on building the app's skeleton, creating the primary user interface, and fetching data from the TMDB API.

#### Week 1: Project Setup & Home Screen
- Initialize the Flutter project and set up the development environment.
- Implement the main app navigation, including the bottom navigation bar.
- Develop the home screen UI with placeholders for the horizontally scrolling carousels.

#### Week 2: API Integration & Dedicated Sections
- Integrate the TMDB API using the dio package for network requests.
- Populate the home screen carousels ("Trending Today," "Now Playing," etc.) with live data.
- Build the UI for the dedicated Movies, TV Shows, and Anime sections with a grid view layout.

#### Week 3: Detailed View & Basic Search
- Create the detailed content view screen, displaying the poster, synopsis, rating, and other information from the API.
- Implement a basic search functionality that allows users to search for content by title.

### Phase 2: State Management & User Authentication (Weeks 4-6)

This phase focuses on making the app interactive and personalized by adding state management and user accounts.

#### Week 4: State Management with Riverpod
- Integrate the flutter_riverpod package for state management.
- Refactor the existing code to use Riverpod providers for managing the app's state, such as the lists of movies and TV shows.

#### Week 5: Firebase Integration & Authentication
- Set up a Firebase project and integrate it into the Flutter app.
- Implement user authentication using Firebase Auth, including email/password, Google Sign-In, and Apple Sign-In.
- Create the UI for the login and registration screens.

#### Week 6: User Profiles & Personal Lists
- Develop the user profile screen.
- Use Cloud Firestore to store user-specific data, such as "Watchlist," "Favorites," and "Watched History."
- Implement the functionality to add and remove items from these lists on the detailed content view.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polishing (Weeks 7-9)

The final phase is about refining the user experience with advanced features and ensuring the app is polished and robust.

#### Week 7: Advanced Search & Filtering
- Enhance the search functionality with real-time suggestions as the user types.
- Implement filtering and sorting options in the dedicated content sections (by genre, release year, etc.).
- Refine the anime section by filtering content based on the 'Animation' genre and keywords.

#### Week 8: Local Caching & Settings
- Integrate a local database like Hive or Drift to cache API responses. This will reduce network calls and provide limited offline access.
- Develop the app settings screen, including options for theme switching (Light, Dark, System Default) and clearing the local cache.

#### Week 9: Final Touches & Testing
- Embed video trailers on the detailed content view.
- Add a "Similar Titles" carousel to the detailed view.
- Conduct thorough testing, fix bugs, and optimize the app's performance.

## 2. Proposed Project Structure 📂

A well-organized project structure is crucial for scalability and maintainability. We'll use a feature-first approach, which is a popular and effective method for structuring Flutter apps.

```

├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── api/             # API clients and data sources (e.g., tmdb_api.dart)
│   │   ├── services/        # Business logic services (e.g., auth_service.dart)
│   │   └── models/          # Data models (e.g., movie.dart, tv_show.dart)
│   │
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── home/

│   │
│   └── shared/
│       ├── widgets/         # Reusable widgets (e.g., custom_button.dart)
│       ├── theme/           # App theme data (e.g., app_theme.dart)
│       └── utils/           # Utility functions and constants

└── main.dart                # App entry point
```

### Explanation of Key Directories:

- **core**: Contains the foundational logic of the app, such as API clients, services, and data models. This code is not specific to any particular feature.

- **features**: Each feature of the app (e.g., home, movies, authentication) has its own directory. This modular approach makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.
  - **presentation**: Holds all the UI-related code for a feature, including screens and widgets.
  - **application**: Contains the state management logic for a feature, such as Riverpod providers and notifiers.

- **shared**: Includes code that is used across multiple features, such as reusable widgets, theme data, and utility functions.

## 3. Key UI/UX Considerations ✨

A modern and intuitive UI is essential for a media discovery app. Here are some recommendations:

### Modern Aesthetics:
- **Dark Mode**: A dark theme is a must-have for media apps, as it's easier on the eyes in low-light conditions.
- **Glassmorphism/Neumorphism**: Consider using subtle glassmorphism or neumorphism effects for UI elements like cards and buttons to create a sense of depth and modernity.
- **High-Quality Imagery**: Leverage the high-resolution posters and backdrop images from the TMDB API to create a visually rich experience.

### Engaging Interactions:
- **Micro-interactions**: Implement subtle animations and feedback for user actions, such as tapping a button or adding an item to a list.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Use smooth page transitions and animations to create a fluid and seamless navigation experience.

### Intuitive User Experience:
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Ensure a clear visual hierarchy on each screen, with important information (like titles and ratings) being more prominent.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: The infinite-scrolling grid view in the dedicated sections will allow users to browse content effortlessly.
- **Personalization**: The ability to create personal lists and switch themes will make the app feel more tailored to each user.

## 4. Technology Stack 📚
