# 🔧 Environment Variables Fix Summary

## The Problem
GitHub Actions build was failing with:
```
Error detected in pubspec.yaml:
No file or variants found for asset: .env.
```

This happened because the `.env` file (containing API keys) wasn't available in the GitHub Actions build environment.

## The Solution
We implemented a secure approach using GitHub Secrets to inject environment variables during the build process.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Added .env file creation step** before `flutter pub get`
- **Added .env file cleanup** in the cleanup section
- Uses GitHub Secrets to populate environment variables securely

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling (`lib/main.dart`)
- **Made dotenv loading more robust** with try-catch
- **Added graceful handling** for missing .env files
- Prevents crashes when .env file is not available

### 3. Improved Fallback Values
- **Updated `lib/src/shared/widgets/optimized_image.dart`**
- **Updated `lib/src/core/services/image_prefetch_service.dart`**
- Added proper fallback URLs for TMDB image base URL
- Changed from empty string `''` to `'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p'`

### 4. Updated Documentation
- **Enhanced `.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`** with environment variable instructions
- **Created `.github/ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** with step-by-step secret setup
- **Added troubleshooting section** for .env file issues

## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

```
TMDB_API_KEY        = [Your TMDB API key]
TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN   = [Your TMDB access token] 
TMDB_BASE_URL       = https://api.themoviedb.org/3
TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL = https://image.tmdb.org/t/p
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **Local Development**: Uses your local `.env` file as before
2. **GitHub Actions**: Creates temporary `.env` file using secrets during build
3. **Security**: Secrets are encrypted, never exposed in logs
4. **Cleanup**: Temporary `.env` file is removed after build

## ✅ Benefits

- 🔒 **Secure**: API keys stored as encrypted GitHub Secrets
- 🚀 **Automated**: No manual intervention needed for builds
- 🛡️ **Safe**: No secrets in repository code or commit history
- 🔄 **Flexible**: Can update secrets without changing code
- 📱 **Robust**: Graceful fallbacks prevent build failures

## 🧪 Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Code compiles without errors (`flutter analyze` passed)
- ✅ Proper fallback values are in place
- ✅ Error handling works correctly
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow syntax is valid

## 🎉 Result

Your GitHub Actions releases will now:
1. **Create .env file** with your TMDB credentials
2. **Build successfully** without the "No file found" error
3. **Generate APKs** with working API integration
4. **Clean up securely** by removing temporary files

Just add the required GitHub Secrets and your releases will work perfectly! 🚀
